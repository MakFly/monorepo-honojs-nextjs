Run this command from the root of the `monorepo` directory to start both the `auth-service` and the `web` application in development mode with hot-reloading.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You can now access:
- Web App: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Auth Service: [http://localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001)
